Hailing from Pittsburgh, I’m a software developer and tutor with a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** from the University of Pittsburgh. I specialize in **backend development, algorithms, and data structures** areas I find endlessly fascinating because they form the foundation of innovation. 

My journey into tech began at 17, when I discovered the limitless potential of programming. Since then, I’ve embraced coding as a superpower that empowers me to create, innovate, and make a meaningful impact. Whether it’s contributing to **open-source projects**, tutoring aspiring developers, or experimenting with new technologies, I’m driven by a passion for learning and collaboration.
